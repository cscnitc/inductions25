Digital forensics is very much an art. Can take a long time before you figure out how to unwrap something hidden in plain sight.

## How to get started

Use [wireshark docs](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterIntroduction.html) for network forensics, and also read up on [file formats](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/).

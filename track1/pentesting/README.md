# Pentesting

![Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/images/notebook-kali-2024.1.jpg "Kali Linux")
I would have loved to make a box for you guys to solve and find the flag, but it's midsems currently :(

## Special offer

If you're someone you already has experience with solving boxes, then you don't have to solve any of these tasks in any domains - just make a blank pull request, and you'll be directly called to an interview. In any case, we still recommend solving atleast a single medium box on HTB/THM, as a proof of interest and skill.

## How to get started

If you don't know what pentesting is, its the short form for "penetration testing". It refers to techniques used to test security of computer systems, and attempts to exploit them. To get started with pentesting, try out either [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines) or [TryHackme](https://tryhackme.com/module/introduction-to-offensive-pentesting).

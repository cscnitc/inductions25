# Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning  Tasks

![Deep learning is just convex optimization](/img/mlmeme.png)

To be fair, calling it AI/ML is confusing - these tasks do not refer to using AI or ML to find holes, but to find holes in AI and ML approaches themselves. This field is relatively new, and called as _adversarial machine learning_

## How to get started
I hope you have more than a basic understanding of neural networks, and associated concepts, such as gradient descent, for example.
If you don't, then there is a very popular course by [Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)

Once you got the basics down, then you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyL3yN2R7hs), read [this book](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/)(WIP), and solve [these challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-village-capture-the-flag-defcon31/data) on Kaggle. The solutions are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNqtaMyw8c4).

_If you are choosing this domain, then you don't have to submit any task in any other domain_

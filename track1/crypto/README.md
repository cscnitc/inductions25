# Cryptography tasks

So you decided on crypto? you must like math and logic, great!
These tasks are designed to test everyone, from the beginner knowing nothing (yet willing to learn), to the seasoned cryptanalyst.

## Special offer

If you already know basic crypto, and think you can take part in [NSUCRYPTO](https://nsucrypto.nsu.ru/), then you are special! 
What's NSUCRYPTO? It's like an olympiad in cryptography.

We will allow you to join the club without submitting any task, on the condition that you solve atleast 1 problem in the individual round of NSUCRYPTO this year, as well as take part in the group round, and pass our interview.
In any case, we still recommend that you submit atleast the crypto tasks, since these should be a breeze for you anyway.
Contact rehan at mohammed_b231090pe (at) nitc domain for more details on this.

## How to get started

If you're absolutely new, we suggest trying out [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1) or [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/courses/intro/course_details/). They assume only elementary computer programming as a prereq, and require only 10th grade level math to proceed.

The latter website is also useful for intermediate and harder concepts such as elliptic curve cryptography, and lattice cryptography.

If you want to [get started with theoretical cryptography](https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/how-do-i-get-into-cryptography-b093c2c600eb), with all the math rigor, then you can take a look at this mathexchange [thread](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/71420/reference-books-on-cryptography). I have found Modern Cryptography by Katz to be good. There's also this [random book](https://toc.cryptobook.us/book.pdf) online.

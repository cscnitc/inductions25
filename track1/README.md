# Track 1 Inductions

# PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT VERY CAREFULLY!

The process is divided into 2 rounds -
1. Round 1 - consists of submitting CTF-style tasks, with write-ups
2. Round 2 - shortlisted individuals will get called to an offline interview

This repository is for submitting the tasks for Round 1.

All prospective inductees will have 10 days to submit the tasks - till 11:59PM, 4 October, 2025.

The tasks are grouped by domain, and in general, each individual must submit tasks in atleast 2 domains to continue(exceptions are listed as such where they apply). There will be bonus tasks for those who weren't able to do enough tasks, have time, want to challenge themselves, or want to show off their existing cybersec skills.


## For the n00b

This can easily be overwhelming for someone new, and it might not be feasible to learn all this, and submit the tasks on time. We understand. In this case, we encourage you to join the Track 2 Inductions instead, if you are a first or second year student.

It may be possible you don't know some elementary topics that we expect - such as programming, or git. This is completely understandable, and usually the norm for first-year students.

If you are confident that cybersecurity is something that awes you everytime you think of "hacking", and are passionate, then here are a few pointers to get started -

1. Programming forms the foundation for anything we do in this club. Without knowing how to code, you can't make computers do anything. Hence, its highly recommended to get started with a versatile, yet easy language like [Python](https://python.org). Python is widely used for scripting, and probably the most popular language in existence today. Personally, I used [Learning Python](https://cfm.ehu.es/ricardo/docs/python/Learning_Python.pdf) by Mark Lutz. There's also the extremely popular [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/) course, if you prefer videos.
2. You will also need to get comfortable with what's called the "shell" or the command-line interface. The buttons and windows you are used to clicking are nice and user-friendly, but do not offer precision, and automation. [This](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) is a very simple intro, but I suggest using an O'Reilly/Packt book for a more comprehensive understanding. You can usually pirate them on LibGen.
If you want to learn the CLI on Linux, but do not have it installed, please contact [FOSSCell](mailto:fosscell@nitc.ac.in). They will help you install Linux on your laptop.


## Disclaimer

We do not forbid the use of generative AI, or using search engines at all. But we *highly discourage* it - use of AI has been linked to [cognitive decline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872). The problem with using AI lies in that you don't learn the mechanics of how to solve a problem, since it does that for you. AI can be used for doing "boring" tasks, such as finding the password from .bashrc history file, or something of that sort. But to use it to solve a task would be disservice to yourself; you don't learn anything. In the same way, we encourage using search engines to find more material on how to solve a task, but discourage using them for finding the flag. Even if you do stumble upon it, restrain yourself, and try figuring it out yourself. This way you actually learn something.
We hope that this small paragraph has convinced you on how to use AI. If not, be well aware that we do not entertain AI usage during the interview :) and we will make sure you know what YOU did.

## Submission

While we highly recommend submitting *ALL* the tasks in a particular domain, we are considerate to beginners, and it is fine if you submit a single task in each domain. Each domain will have a "dummy" task called Task 0, that is supposed to help you get acquainted with the absolute basics of the domain. This task isn't considered for submission, and a write-up is not at all necessary.

Make sure to submit your tasks, even if you "feel" they're wrong/incomplete. We value effort and attempts a lot, so don't be disheartened if you couldn't finish the tasks on time. Feel free to ask doubts, and hints in the group chat, but DO NOT share the solutions in the group or your friends, no matter how close they are. Likewise, we also expect you to not ask solutions from your friends.

To submit, create a write-up document detailing your solution process for all the tasks you solved. Make sure to include relevant screenshots, and cite sources when necessary. At the same time, create a github repo with the code used for solving the task. Make sure the repository is private(will be checked during interview). Upload the document in this [form](https://forms.gle/adYuqhhw3UdKXf1t9), and you're done. We recommend using LaTeX, but any way is fine.

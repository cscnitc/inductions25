This one's straightforward. Read this [book](https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en/). Use [PortSwigger Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security) for additional reference

Task - read the entire book, and supplement it with practicals from the lab.

## Evaluation

1. Interview [40%] - How much you know, and how much you understood.
2. PortSwigger Labs [40%] - How many attacks could you actually implement?
3. Development of any novel attack vector [20%]

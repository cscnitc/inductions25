# Track 2 Round 2

## Introduction

Excuse us for the delay in getting things started, but it was necessary to come up with the most appropriate way to gauge interests of prospective inductees.

For this round, each of you will work on an assignment throughout this month - till December 29th, 11:59PM IST. The assignment can either be subjective, where the problem is open-ended, and involves broad research, or objective, in which case, you will have to meet certain requirements. For each assignment there exists a detailed evaluation criteria and a list of deliverables (if applicable). You will be allowed to choose an order of preference for the assignments, but we get final say in alloting them. Take the next day to read further about the topics that interest you, and appropriately submit your preferences. The preference form will close on 5th December, 2:00PM IST, and it will be assumed that those who haven't submitted are forfeiting the inductions.

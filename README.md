# Cyber Security Club Inductions

![Club logo](./img/csclogo.png)

Welcome to our inductions for the year 2025. It appears we have successfully convinced you that we are a club worthy of your time and attention.
We have proved ourselves, and now it time for you to prove yourself.


This year, we shall recruit via two tracks -
1. [Track 1](./track1) - a 10 day long induction process (deadline is 30 September), where the prospective inductees solve CTF-style challenges, and submit their write-ups. This is open to all years, and all branches. We recommend this track for those who already have prior experience with programming, and Linux environments. If you're not sure which track to pick, read the guidelines for this track, and check out some of the tasks.
2. [Track 2](./track2) - a 3-month long induction process, where prospective inductees are given tasks, with appropriate deadlines, ending by the beginning of the next semester. This channel is open ONLY to first and second year students. We request all newcomers, and beginners in programming, and cybersec to pick this track. If you wanna join the channel via this round, please fill up [this]() form, and join the linked WhatsApp group.

All the best, and happy hacking!

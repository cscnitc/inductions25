This year, we shall recruit via two tracks -
1. [Track 1](./track1) - a 10 day long induction process (deadline is 11 October), where the prospective inductees solve CTF-style challenges, and submit their write-ups. This is open to all years, and all branches. We recommend this track for those who already have prior experience with programming, and Linux environments. If you're not sure which track to pick, read the guidelines for this track, and check out some of the tasks.
2. [Track 2](./track2) - a 3-month long induction process, where prospective inductees are given tasks, with appropriate deadlines, ending by the beginning of the next semester. This channel is open ONLY to first and second year students. We request all newcomers, and beginners in programming, and cybersec to pick this track. If you wanna join this track, please read [this](./track2), fill the form, and join the linked WhatsApp group.

We'll also take a select few who are more into design, marketing, or webdev. If thats you, fill this [form](https://forms.gle/daFZFt3ToKa7araE8).
